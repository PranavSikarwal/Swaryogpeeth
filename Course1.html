                    <h1>Training Schedule</h1>
                </div>
                <div class="detail_detail">
                    This 200 hour Yoga teacher training program in Rishikesh is designed to be a comprehensive and intensive learning experience, with a daily schedule that is packed with up to 10 hours of instruction. This includes both contact hours, where you will be directly interacting with your instructors, as well as non-contact hours, where you will be learning through independent study and self-practice. Attending each class is essential to your growth as a student. You will not only acquire knowledge from your teachers and textbooks, but also from your daily interactions and experiences in school. By fully immersing yourself in the school environment and following the schedule, you will develop valuable life skills that will shape your future.
                    <br><br>
                    It’s important to note that all classes are mandatory, unless there is a legitimate emergency or illness that prevents you from attending. If you need to take leave, it’s important to secure permission from the relevant teachers. Failure to do so will negatively impact your monthly performance. Embracing the school program and adapting to its routines can be a challenge, especially if you are used to different habits. However, by surrendering to the program and putting in effort to follow the schedule, you will have the opportunity to experience significant growth and see the world through a new lens.
                    <br><br>
                    Despite the demanding schedule, the program is designed to be both challenging and enlightening, providing you with a thorough understanding of all aspects of Yoga. To ensure that you are always on track, you will receive a printed copy of the confirmed daily schedule at the start of the program, during the Opening Ceremony. However, it is important to note that the schedule may be subject to minor adjustments, depending on the season or any other relevant factors.

                    <li><strong>level of yoga experience:</strong> A minimum of 3 months of consistent yoga practice is recommended prior to the course, to ensure that students are comfortable with basic yoga postures and can fully benefit from the training. It is useful to have participated in Ashtanga or Vinyasa Flow styles of yoga before joining the program, as they are dynamic and fluid forms of yoga. If you’ve been involved with a closely related fitness or sports training background, this may also be an advantage to you, but this is not essential. While it is not essential to have years of experience on the mat, signing up with an open heart and an open mind are the best two things you can bring with you.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical requirements:</strong> The program can be physically demanding at times, so students should be in good physical health and able to perform the physical requirements of the program. This includes being able to stand for long periods, holding yoga postures and practicing yoga sequences.</li>

                <div class="detail_detail">
                    Yoga believes the body is made of five elements and food also contains five elements and has six tastes. When we consume food that contains each element that is called a balanced diet or yogic diet. The whole science of Ayurveda is based on these principles. Everyone has different tastes. This is not only because of their habits but it is because of what actually the body needs. When we consume food without proper knowledge of what our body needs, we create diseases. However, when we consume food that has all the necessary elements, we are healthy and satisfied.
                    <br><br>
                    Yogic food contains proper nutrients that the body needs to grow. Consuming too little or too much food is also very risky for our health, so a holistic diet is very important. Yogis always avoid tamasic food like meat, egg, etc. Avoiding tamasic food helps you become more flexible and compassionate. Listen to Guruji’s lecture on Vegetarianism.
                    <br><br>
                    A vegetarian or a healthy diet consists of green vegetables, fresh fruits, lentils, beans, plant-based oils like coconut, mustard, peanuts etc. This kind of food is easy to digest and makes us feel lighter, at peaceful, and conscious
